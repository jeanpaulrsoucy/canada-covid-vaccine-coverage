# Vaccine Coverage Time Series for Canada

Vaccine coverage time series for Canada (dose 1, dose 2, dose 3), by province/territory, derived from datasets made available by the [Public Health Agency of Canada](https://health-infobase.canada.ca/covid-19/vaccination-coverage/) and the [COVID-19 Canada Open Data Working Group](https://github.com/ccodwg/Covid19Canada).

The final datasets are available in the `data` directory in wide format (`canada_vc_ts.csv`) and long format (`canada_vc_ts_long.csv`).

A brief report describes the dataset and how it was derived: [click here to read as HTML](https://jeanpaulrsoucy.github.io/canada-covid-vaccine-coverage/canada_vc_ts.html).
